# Conway's Game of Life
A pythonic implementation of a cellular automaton 
following the rules of Conway's Game of Life.

In order to run, download the repo and run "python life.py"
A matrix will appear in the terminal that follows the rules of Life
where:

1 = 'living cell'
0 = 'dead cell'


# NOTES

Try changing up the initial conditions or the size of the matrix
to see if you can build gliders or other interesting things.

There are also other rules in this script that are currently commented out.
Try changing those too to see what other interesting behavior you can see.
